# 2DMAPVIZ

## Very simple visualisation tool to help with the linear algebra aspect of coordinate system mapping and to help vizualize on web interface generated maps from robot environnement

### Most robotic mapping system draw the map in the frame of the robot, so it is importatn to know how to map from the map system to another one to ease the rendering on the client side and to be able to set an initial position for the robot in regards to anothe frame

## GETTING STARTED

### We need some kind of live server to run the client on a browser (liver server code extension works well) and we need tsc to transpile the source files into javascript

### Transpile typescript source files
```
tsc
```

### Start live server (vscode extention or with python)
```
